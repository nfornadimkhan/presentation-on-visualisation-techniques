# Data Visualization Techniques Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates various data visualization techniques using Python, focusing on effective ways to represent and analyze data. The project includes visualizations of climate data, agricultural datasets, and other relevant information sources.

## Project Structure
- `khan_coursework1_presentation.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the visualization code and analysis
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used in the analysis
- `visualization_created/`: Directory containing generated visualizations
- `khan_coursework1_presentation.pdf`: PDF version of the presentation

## Tools and Technologies
Data analysis and visualizations were performed using Python libraries:
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: Numerical computing
- Matplotlib: Basic plotting and visualization
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization
- Plotly: Interactive visualizations
- Pillow: Image processing
